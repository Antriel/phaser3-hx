/**
	A Pointer object encapsulates both mouse and touch input within Phaser.
	
	By default, Phaser will create 2 pointers for your game to use. If you require more, i.e. for a multi-touch
	game, then use the `InputPlugin.addPointer` method to do so, rather than instantiating this class directly,
	otherwise it won't be managed by the input system.
	
	You can reference the current active pointer via `InputPlugin.activePointer`. You can also use the properties
	`InputPlugin.pointer1` through to `pointer10`, for each pointer you have enabled in your game.
	
	The properties of this object are set by the Input Plugin during processing. This object is then sent in all
	input related events that the Input Plugin emits, so you can reference properties from it directly in your
	callbacks.
