/**
	The Bitmap Mask Pipeline handles all of the bitmap mask rendering in WebGL for applying
	alpha masks to Game Objects. It works by sampling two texture on the fragment shader and
	using the fragments alpha to clip the region.
	
	The fragment shader it uses can be found in `shaders/src/BitmapMask.frag`.
	The vertex shader it uses can be found in `shaders/src/BitmapMask.vert`.
	
	The default shader attributes for this pipeline are:
	
	`inPosition` (vec2, offset 0)
	
	The default shader uniforms for this pipeline are:
	
	`uResolution` (vec2)
	`uMainSampler` (sampler2D)
	`uMaskSampler` (sampler2D)
	`uInvertMaskAlpha` (bool)
