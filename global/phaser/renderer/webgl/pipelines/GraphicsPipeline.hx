/**
	The Graphics Pipeline is the rendering pipeline used by Phaser in WebGL when drawing
	primitive geometry objects, such as the Graphics Game Object, or the Shape Game Objects
	such as Arc, Line, Rectangle and Star. It handles the preperation and batching of related vertices.
	
	Prior to Phaser v3.50 the functions of this pipeline were merged with the `TextureTintPipeline`.
	
	The fragment shader it uses can be found in `shaders/src/Graphics.frag`.
	The vertex shader it uses can be found in `shaders/src/Graphics.vert`.
	
	The default shader attributes for this pipeline are:
	
	`inPosition` (vec2)
	`inColor` (vec4, normalized)
	
	The default shader uniforms for this pipeline are:
	
	`uProjectionMatrix` (mat4)
