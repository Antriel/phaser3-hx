/**
	The Light Pipeline is an extension of the Multi Pipeline and uses a custom shader
	designed to handle forward diffused rendering of 2D lights in a Scene.
	
	The shader works in tandem with Light Game Objects, and optionally texture normal maps,
	to provide an ambient illumination effect.
	
	If you wish to provide your own shader, you can use the `%LIGHT_COUNT%` declaration in the source,
	and it will be automatically replaced at run-time with the total number of configured lights.
	
	The maximum number of lights can be set in the Render Config `maxLights` property and defaults to 10.
	
	Prior to Phaser v3.50 this pipeline was called the `ForwardDiffuseLightPipeline`.
	
	The fragment shader it uses can be found in `shaders/src/Light.frag`.
	The vertex shader it uses can be found in `shaders/src/Multi.vert`.
	
	The default shader attributes for this pipeline are:
	
	`inPosition` (vec2, offset 0)
	`inTexCoord` (vec2, offset 8)
	`inTexId` (float, offset 16)
	`inTintEffect` (float, offset 20)
	`inTint` (vec4, offset 24, normalized)
	
	The default shader uniforms for this pipeline are those from the Multi Pipeline, plus:
	
	`uMainSampler` (sampler2D)
	`uNormSampler` (sampler2D)
	`uCamera` (vec4)
	`uResolution` (vec2)
	`uAmbientLightColor` (vec3)
	`uInverseRotationMatrix` (mat3)
	`uLights` (Light struct)
