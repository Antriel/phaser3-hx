/**
	The Rope Pipeline is a variation of the Multi Pipeline that uses a `TRIANGLE_STRIP` for
	its topology, instead of TRIANGLES. This is primarily used by the Rope Game Object,
	or anything that extends it.
	
	Prior to Phaser v3.50 this pipeline was called the `TextureTintStripPipeline`.
	
	The fragment shader it uses can be found in `shaders/src/Multi.frag`.
	The vertex shader it uses can be found in `shaders/src/Multi.vert`.
	
	The default shader attributes for this pipeline are:
	
	`inPosition` (vec2, offset 0)
	`inTexCoord` (vec2, offset 8)
	`inTexId` (float, offset 16)
	`inTintEffect` (float, offset 20)
	`inTint` (vec4, offset 24, normalized)
	
	The default shader uniforms for this pipeline are:
	
	`uProjectionMatrix` (mat4)
	`uMainSampler` (sampler2D array)
	
	The pipeline is structurally identical to the Multi Pipeline and should be treated as such.
