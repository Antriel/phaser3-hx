/**
	A Sprite Game Object.
	
	A Sprite Game Object is used for the display of both static and animated images in your game.
	Sprites can have input events and physics bodies. They can also be tweened, tinted, scrolled
	and animated.
	
	The main difference between a Sprite and an Image Game Object is that you cannot animate Images.
	As such, Sprites take a fraction longer to process and have a larger API footprint due to the Animation
	Component. If you do not require animation then you can safely use Images to replace Sprites in all cases.

		The benefit of a global animation is that multiple Sprites can all play the same animation, without
		having to duplicate the data. You can just create it once and then play it on any Sprite.
		
		The following code shows how to create a global repeating animation. The animation will be created
		from all of the frames within the sprite sheet that was loaded with the key 'muybridge':
		
		```javascript
		var config = {
		     key: 'run',
		     frames: 'muybridge',
		     frameRate: 15,
		     repeat: -1
		};
		
		//  This code should be run from within a Scene:
		this.anims.create(config);
		```
		
		However, if you wish to create an animation that is unique to this Sprite, and this Sprite alone,
		you can call the `Animation.create` method instead. It accepts the exact same parameters as when
		creating a global animation, however the resulting data is kept locally in this Sprite.
		
		With the animation created, either globally or locally, you can now play it on this Sprite:
		
		```javascript
		this.add.sprite(x, y).play('run');
		```
		
		Alternatively, if you wish to run it at a different frame rate, for example, you can pass a config
		object instead:
		
		```javascript
		this.add.sprite(x, y).play({ key: 'run', frameRate: 24 });
		```
		
		When playing an animation on a Sprite it will first check to see if it can find a matching key
		locally within the Sprite. If it can, it will play the local animation. If not, it will then
		search the global Animation Manager and look for it there.
		
		If you need a Sprite to be able to play both local and global animations, make sure they don't
		have conflicting keys.
		
		See the documentation for the `PlayAnimationConfig` config object for more details about this.
		
		Also, see the documentation in the Animation Manager for further details on creating animations.
