	A PathFollower Game Object.
	
	A PathFollower is a Sprite Game Object with some extra helpers to allow it to follow a Path automatically.
	
	Anything you can do with a standard Sprite can be done with this PathFollower, such as animate it, tint it,
	scale it and so on.
	
	PathFollowers are bound to a single Path at any one time and can traverse the length of the Path, from start
	to finish, forwards or backwards, or from any given point on the Path to its end. They can optionally rotate
	to face the direction of the path, be offset from the path coordinates or rotate independently of the Path.
