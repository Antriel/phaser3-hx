/**
	An Extern Game Object is a special type of Game Object that allows you to pass
	rendering off to a 3rd party.
	
	When you create an Extern and place it in the display list of a Scene, the renderer will
	process the list as usual. When it finds an Extern it will flush the current batch,
	clear down the pipeline and prepare a transform matrix which your render function can
	take advantage of, if required.
	
	The WebGL context is then left is a 'clean' state, ready for you to bind your own shaders,
	or draw to it, whatever you wish to do. Once you've finished, you should free-up any
	of your resources. The Extern will then rebind the Phaser pipeline and carry on 
	rendering the display list.
	
	Although this object has lots of properties such as Alpha, Blend Mode and Tint, none of
	them are used during rendering unless you take advantage of them in your own render code.

		If this Game Object has previously been enabled for input, this will queue it
		for removal, causing it to no longer be interactive. The removal happens on
		the next game step, it is not immediate.
		
		The Interactive Object that was assigned to this Game Object will be destroyed,
		removed from the Input Manager and cleared from this Game Object.
		
		If you wish to re-enable this Game Object at a later date you will need to
		re-create its InteractiveObject by calling `setInteractive` again.
		
		If you wish to only temporarily stop an object from receiving input then use
		`disableInteractive` instead, as that toggles the interactive state, where-as
		this erases it completely.
		
		If you wish to resize a hit area, don't remove and then set it as being
		interactive. Instead, access the hitarea object directly and resize the shape
		being used. I.e.: `sprite.input.hitArea.setSize(width, height)` (assuming the
		shape is a Rectangle, which it is by default.)
