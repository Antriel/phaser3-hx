/**
	A Text Game Object.
	
	Text objects work by creating their own internal hidden Canvas and then renders text to it using
	the standard Canvas `fillText` API. It then creates a texture from this canvas which is rendered
	to your game during the render pass.
	
	Because it uses the Canvas API you can take advantage of all the features this offers, such as
	applying gradient fills to the text, or strokes, shadows and more. You can also use custom fonts
	loaded externally, such as Google or TypeKit Web fonts.
	
	**Important:** The font name must be quoted if it contains certain combinations of digits or
	special characters, either when creating the Text object, or when setting the font via `setFont`
	or `setFontFamily`, e.g.:
	
	```javascript
	this.add.text(0, 0, 'Hello World', { fontFamily: 'Georgia, "Goudy Bookletter 1911", Times, serif' });
	```
	
	```javascript
	this.add.text(0, 0, 'Hello World', { font: '"Press Start 2P"' });
	```
	
	You can only display fonts that are currently loaded and available to the browser: therefore fonts must
	be pre-loaded. Phaser does not do ths for you, so you will require the use of a 3rd party font loader,
	or have the fonts ready available in the CSS on the page in which your Phaser game resides.
	
	See {@link http://www.jordanm.co.uk/tinytype this compatibility table} for the available default fonts
	across mobile browsers.
	
	A note on performance: Every time the contents of a Text object changes, i.e. changing the text being
	displayed, or the style of the text, it needs to remake the Text canvas, and if on WebGL, re-upload the
	new texture to the GPU. This can be an expensive operation if used often, or with large quantities of
	Text objects in your game. If you run into performance issues you would be better off using Bitmap Text
	instead, as it benefits from batching and avoids expensive Canvas API calls.
