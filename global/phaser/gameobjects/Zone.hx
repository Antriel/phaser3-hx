/**
	A Zone Game Object.
	
	A Zone is a non-rendering rectangular Game Object that has a position and size.
	It has no texture and never displays, but does live on the display list and
	can be moved, scaled and rotated like any other Game Object.
	
	Its primary use is for creating Drop Zones and Input Hit Areas and it has a couple of helper methods
	specifically for this. It is also useful for object overlap checks, or as a base for your own
	non-displaying Game Objects.
	The default origin is 0.5, the center of the Zone, the same as with Game Objects.
