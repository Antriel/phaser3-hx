		Note: Bitmap Masks only work on WebGL. Geometry Masks work on both WebGL and Canvas.
		
		If a mask is already set on this Game Object it will be immediately replaced.
		
		Masks are positioned in global space and are not relative to the Game Object to which they
		are applied. The reason for this is that multiple Game Objects can all share the same mask.
		
		Masks have no impact on physics or input detection. They are purely a rendering component
		that allows you to limit what is visible during the render pass.
