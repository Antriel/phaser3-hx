/**
	The Point Light Game Object provides a way to add a point light effect into your game,
	without the expensive shader processing requirements of the traditional Light Game Object.
	
	The difference is that the Point Light renders using a custom shader, designed to give the
	impression of a point light source, of variable radius, intensity and color, in your game.
	However, unlike the Light Game Object, it does not impact any other Game Objects, or use their
	normal maps for calcuations. This makes them extremely fast to render compared to Lights
	and perfect for special effects, such as flickering torches or muzzle flashes.
	
	For maximum performance you should batch Point Light Game Objects together. This means
	ensuring they follow each other consecutively on the display list. Ideally, use a Layer
	Game Object and then add just Point Lights to it, so that it can batch together the rendering
	of the lights. You don't _have_ to do this, and if you've only a handful of Point Lights in
	your game then it's perfectly safe to mix them into the dislay list as normal. However, if
	you're using a large number of them, please consider how they are mixed into the display list.
	
	The renderer will automatically cull Point Lights. Those with a radius that does not intersect
	with the Camera will be skipped in the rendering list. This happens automatically and the
	culled state is refreshed every frame, for every camera.
	
	The origin of a Point Light is always 0.5 and it cannot be changed.
	
	Point Lights are a WebGL only feature and do not have a Canvas counterpart.

		shape is a Rectangle, which it is by default.)
