/**
	A Blitter Game Object.
	
	The Blitter Game Object is a special kind of container that creates, updates and manages Bob objects.
	Bobs are designed for rendering speed rather than flexibility. They consist of a texture, or frame from a texture,
	a position and an alpha value. You cannot scale or rotate them. They use a batched drawing method for speed
	during rendering.
	
	A Blitter Game Object has one texture bound to it. Bobs created by the Blitter can use any Frame from this
	Texture to render with, but they cannot use any other Texture. It is this single texture-bind that allows
	them their speed.
	
	If you have a need to blast a large volume of frames around the screen then Blitter objects are well worth
	investigating. They are especially useful for using as a base for your own special effects systems.
